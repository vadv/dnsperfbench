# dnsperfbench
DNS Performance Benchmarker

dnsperfbench is a command line tool to compare performance of popular public DNS resolvers from your computer, including Google Public DNS, OpenDNS and Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1.

You may optionally specify IP addresses of additional resolvers to include in the benchmark, for example the IP address of your ISP's resolver.

For each resolver, dnsperfbench first runs runs a few tests for a specific FQDN, to ensure the resolver has the response in cache.
Next, dnsperfbench tests cache hit performance (basically round trip latency; we call this ResolverHit) and cache miss performance against various major authoritative DNS providers.
Each test is repeated 15 times.

Once all the tests have finished, dnsperfbench shows the results per resolver (median and mean RTT and % tests that failed) and computes an overall performance score per resolver. The lower the score, the better was the resolver's performance.

Example of the overall Summary:

```
========== Summary ===========
Scores (lower is better)
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
|            RESOLVER            | PERFORMANCE SCORE |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
| 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)           |              1983 |
| 208.67.222.222 (OpenDNS)       |              3175 |
| 199.85.126.20 (Norton)         |              3846 |
| 8.8.8.8 (Google)               |              6275 |
| 185.228.168.168 (Clean         |             12825 |
| Browsing)                      |                   |
| 9.9.9.9 (Quad9)                |             14677 |
| 8.26.56.26 (Comodo)            |            200494 |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
You should probably use 1.1.1.1 as your default resolver
```

... and the Summary of running dnsperfbench at the same location but from another ISP:

```
========== Summary ===========
Scores (lower is better)
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
|            RESOLVER            | PERFORMANCE SCORE |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
| 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)           |              1720 |
| 199.85.126.20 (Norton)         |              3031 |
| 8.8.8.8 (Google)               |              5580 |
| 185.228.168.168 (Clean         |              7205 |

| 208.67.222.222 (OpenDNS)       |             12415 |
| 9.9.9.9 (Quad9)                |             62491 |
| 8.26.56.26 (Comodo)            |            131040 |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+
You should probably use 1.1.1.1 as your default resolver
```

While Cloudflare happened to be the best in both cases, performance of OpenDNS was quite different.

The performance score is calculated using the following formula:
`5 * (ResolverHit mean + ResolverHit median) + ( for each auth: (auth mean + auth median) )`
A failed test is treated as the test taking 10 seconds.

## httptest

New functionality `-httptest` benchmarks the performance of a given http(s) endpoint using the answer returned by various resolvers.

Example

```

```

Behind the scenes, the tool fetches `https://turbobytes.akamaized.net/static/rum/100kb-image.jpg` 10 times for each resolver, using the IP returned by the individual resolver, and reports the result with the median total time.

In the above example, we can see that the best performing IP were returned by my ISP resolver and ECS compatible public resolvers.

This test is bandwidth intensive. In the above example, it ran 10 tests each against 16 resolvers downloading 100KB each time. A total of ~16 MB + TLS handshake overhead.

IPv6 is supported by default.
